            Itâ€™s amazing what a loving home can do for a pup and it takes nothing away from us to be kind to those who are always there with us and for us. In the year 2020, we got the opportunity to foster some pups in our Noida office but due to lockdown, we had to leave them in a dog daycare center. The center is unfortunately now shut and we wish to relocate the pups in Kanpur. We are currently operating here and planning to open a dog boarding where we can give shelter to many other stray dogs who need home. Those of us who work for animal welfare have an incredible blessing to save lives every day. We can share the great feeling of being a hero and a lifesaver by vaccinating and feeding them who are in need with utmost care.
